Due to limitations of Pelican/Markdown I had to employ a couple of hacks:

1. To add a caption to an image use:
    <div class="img-caption">Image caption</div>

2. To divide blocks of code use:
    <div class="divider"></div>

3. To enclose some output in a code block without highlighting use the
   following Markdown construction:
    ```text
    Output goes in here
    ```
4. To interling to another blog article use the following construction:
    [anchor text](/blog/link-to-other-article/)
